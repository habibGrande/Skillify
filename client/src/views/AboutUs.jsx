            Growing up in a small palestinian village, Skillify founder Mutaz Jaber had few educational opportunities â€” until he got a computer. Fueled by his dream to compete in mathematics, he used the internet to learn his way to a silver medal in the International Math Olympiad.
            <br /><br />
            After learning online changed his life, Mutaz partnered with co-founders Ayah Safi and M-Habib Snobur to achieve a common goal: to make quality education accessible to all.
